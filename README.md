# SeekRight_Ai

SeekRight_Ai is a project designed to demonstrate various concepts and solutions using AI and machine learning techniques. This project includes custom implementations of JavaScript operations and aims to provide simple examples of working with AI-related functions in a structured environment.

## Project Overview

The SeekRight_Ai repository contains the following key components:

- Custom implementations of JavaScript functions, such as `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `flatMap`.
- Mathematical operations using different variable types (`let`, `var`, `const`).
- Demonstrations of these functions with sample datasets.
- An example of setting up a simple HTTP server (`simple-http-server` directory).
  
This project is intended for developers looking to explore JavaScript, machine learning basics, and AI concepts in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations:** Demonstrates using `let`, `var`, and `const` for arithmetic calculations.
- **Custom Array Methods:** Includes custom implementations of common JavaScript methods like `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `flatMap`.
- **AI Concepts:** Example code related to AI and machine learning, with a focus on working with data and arrays.
- **Simple HTTP Server:** Contains a basic server implementation to demonstrate setting up a server using JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atufaakhtar/SeekRight_Ai.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SeekRight_Ai
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. To run the project, you can execute the JavaScript code with Node.js. For example, to test the mathematical operations and custom functions:

   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

2. If you're running the simple HTTP server example:

   ```bash
   node simple-http-server/index.js
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the output in the browser.
