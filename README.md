# SeekRight_Ai

SeekRight_Ai is a project designed to demonstrate various concepts and solutions using AI and machine learning techniques. This project includes custom implementations of JavaScript operations and aims to provide simple examples of working with AI-related functions in a structured environment.

## Project Overview

The SeekRight_Ai repository contains the following key components:

- Custom implementations of JavaScript functions, such as `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `flatMap`.
- Mathematical operations using different variable types (`let`, `var`, `const`).
- Demonstrations of these functions with sample datasets.
- An example of setting up a simple HTTP server (`simple-http-server` directory).
  
This project is intended for developers looking to explore JavaScript, machine learning basics, and AI concepts in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations:** Demonstrates using `let`, `var`, and `const` for arithmetic calculations.
- **Custom Array Methods:** Includes custom implementations of common JavaScript methods like `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and `flatMap`.
- **AI Concepts:** Example code related to AI and machine learning, with a focus on working with data and arrays.
- **Simple HTTP Server:** Contains a basic server implementation to demonstrate setting up a server using JavaScript.
